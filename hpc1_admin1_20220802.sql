The foundation of the company was built on safety pilot valve, millivolt valve, and remote-control gas fire pit kits/repair parts, as well as various other components for the hearth industry. \r\nWe then diversified our thinking by introducing the Outdoor Fire Products line in 2003 with the manufacturing of fire rings. Today this segment of the business has grown to include high-end electronic ignition fire pits, push-button ignition fire pits, TK Torches, portable fire pits, copper water bowls, outdoor fireplace accessories, outdoor dining, fire and water features, and a selection of stainless-steel components second to none.\r\nHPC Fire Inspiredâ„¢ also designs custom fire features and their control systems of any shape or size for residential or commercial applications.
